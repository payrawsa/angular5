In order to run this application you will need nodejs npm, and mysql database. This guide is for a windows computer. Update credentials for your mysql db in the Database Commands/initial.js file. If you don't want to update make sure you have a user with username: root and password: root and make sure you are using port 3306. 

In order:

1) install nodejs and npm using this guide https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows
2) install mysql https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
2) Go to the root folder and run the command npm start
3) navigate to localhost:7000
4) Follow on screen instructions. Everything is self explanatory at this point. 

Recommendations: I also recommend installing git bash instead of regular windows command prompt which kind of sucks.  

This application uses nodejs server and angularjs framework.

The .sol file is also found in the root directory.
